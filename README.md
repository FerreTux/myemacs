# myemacs
This is my emacs setup
Note all files should be in ~/ 
  The reason for this setup is to work with my Google Drive, Google Backup and Sync 
  ie ~/gDrive is my folder that connects directly to my Google Drive
  This is a incredibly useful feature of Google Drive and I recommend using Backup and Sync for important shared data 
  accross multiple devices.  
  Me personally I am moving my Emacs setup to git, so the ~/gDrive folder is somewhat a relic in respect to emacs setup.
  
  Eventually I will modify the .emacs file to remove this
