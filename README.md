# myemacs
This is my emacs setup
Note .emacs will need to be in your default directory that emacs looks for init files in
All other files should get nested in ~/gdrive 
If you don't have one
1. Open terminal
2. cd ~/
3. mkdir gDrive

  The reason for this setup is to work with my Google Drive, Google Backup and Sync 
  ie ~/gDrive is my folder that connects directly to my Google Drive
  This is a incredibly useful feature of Google Drive and I recommend using Backup and Sync for important shared data 
  accross multiple devices.  
  Me personally I am moving my Emacs setup to git, so the ~/gDrive folder is somewhat a relic in respect to emacs setup.
  
  Eventually I will modify the .emacs file to remove this
